But, you can customize a lot of things if you want more control such as speed control, pause timings, repetitions & custom callbacks.\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n\r\nInclude Jquery in your document. Ghost-typer.js supports all versions of jquery.\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nInclude ghost-typer.js after including Jquery\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"ghost-typer.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nChoose any div or span you want to target for typing simulation using jquery and apply the plugin by `selector.ghosttyper()`\r\n```\r\n$(\"#typing\").ghosttyper({\r\n    messages: ['anything', 'you want', 'it to','type']\r\n});\r\n```\r\nHere, `\"#typing\"` is the container for simulation which can be a `span` or a `div`.\r\nAnd `messages` is an option through which we will pass the text we want it to simulate the typing.\r\n\r\n**Note**: `messages` is an array of text which will be displayed one at a time and is the only option which is mandatory.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Usage\r\nThere are a couple of options which can be altered by passing an options object.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(\"#typing\").ghosttyper(options);\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$(\"#typing\").ghosttyper({\r\n    messages: ['web development', '<coding>', 'dancing','technology'],\r\n    timeWrite: 50,  //time between displaying each chracter\r\n    timeDelete: 30, //time between removing(backspace) each chracter\r\n    timePause: 800, //waiting time after displaying text\r\n    repeat: false,  //loop it indefinitely\r\n    callback: function() {\r\n        console.log('called when the entire array of messages has been completed.');\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAll the above options is optional & can be left off.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The callback will only be called after completion of entire process. Thus, will never be called if repeat is set to true.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nOptions which can be passed as key value pairs as options object.\r\n\r\n| Options Key             | Description                                                                                                                          | Default Value | Mandatory |\r\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|\r\n| messages: Array(String) | The messages which will be ghost-typed                                                                                               | undefined     | Y         |\r\n| timeWrite: Integer      | time(in ms) interval between displaying each character                                                                               | 100           | N         |\r\n| timeDelete: Integer     | time(in ms) interval between erasing each character                                                                                  | 50            | N         |\r\n| timePause: Integer      | time(in ms) interval for which the text stays after its typed                                                                        | 1000          | N         |\r\n| repeat: Boolean         | Whether or not to repeat the whole thing indefinitely                                                                                | true          | N         |\r\n| callback: function      | The callback function which will get called after the whole process is completed. It is applicable only when repeat is set to false. | undefined     | N         |\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n+ Report issues & add feature requests\r\n+ Clone the repo.
